PDDLSIM is a simulator for a PPDDL-like language[^1], with a supporting library to define agents and interface with said simulator, locally, or via a remote connection. PDDLSIM was created for the Bar-Ilan University course ["Introduction to Intelligent, Cognitive, and Knowledge-Based Systems" (89-674)](https://u.cs.biu.ac.il/~kaminkg/teach/current/intsys/).

## Installation

PDDLSIM is available on [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/pddlsim/), requiring no external dependencies. Note that PDDLSIM requires on Python 3.12 or later. Earlier, legacy versions of PDDLSIM are also available on PyPI, but are unsupported.

[^1]: This is despite the fact the project is named **PDDL**SIM and not **PPDDL**SIM.
[^2]: Some PDDL features, like those not featured in classical planning, are unsupported, and some extensions are present.
